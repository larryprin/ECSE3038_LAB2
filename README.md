# ECSE3038_LAB2
lab 2

1) 
-get_all_todos(): creates the array list for the typed in text to go.
- create_todo(): accepts the letters to be placed in the array
- update_todos(): gives the option to select the stored list created
- delete_todos(): gives the option to delete the stored list created


2) the reason for this lab is to become more familiar with the FastAPI python framework. Students will be asked to create functions that will used to handle incoming HTTP requests.

3) my favourite pokemon is Charizard 
Charizard (Japanese: リザードン Lizardon) is a dual-type Fire/Flying Pokémon introduced in Generation I.

It evolves from Charmeleon starting at level 36. It is the final form of Charmander.

Charizard has three other forms.

It can Mega Evolve into two forms:
Mega Charizard X using Charizardite X.
Mega Charizard Y using Charizardite Y.
It has a Gigantamax form.
Charizard is the game mascot of both Pokémon Red and FireRed Versions.
